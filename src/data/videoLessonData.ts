      question: "What is the purpose of measuring?",
      timestamp: 70,
      answered: false,
      choices: [
        "To create confusion",
        "To find out the size or the amount of something, like time, weight, temperature, or speed",
        "To pass the time",
        "To make things complicated",
      ],
      correctAnswer:
        "To find out the size or the amount of something, like time, weight, temperature, or speed",
      feedback: {
        correct:
          "Exactly right! Measuring helps us determine the size, volume, or quantity of objects or substances, which is crucial in everyday life and various scientific fields.",
        incorrect:
          "Not quite. The main purpose of measuring is to determine the size, volume, or quantity of something accurately, which is essential for precision and understanding in various contexts.",

      question:
        "What are some examples of standard units for measuring length?",
      timestamp: 101,
      answered: false,
      choices: [
        "Inches and centimeters",
        "Salamanders and turtles",
        "Cows and hats",
        "Paper clips and erasers",
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Inches and centimeters",
      feedback: {
        correct:
          "Correct! Inches and centimeters are standard units of measurement for length, which allow for consistent and universal understanding of size.",
        incorrect:
          "That's not right. For measuring length, standard units like inches and centimeters are used to ensure consistency and accuracy across measurements.",

      question:
        "What are the important rules mentioned for measuring length with non-standard units?",
      timestamp: 201,
      answered: false,
      choices: [
        "All units must be different sizes",
        "Units should overlap each other",
        "Units should be the same size and direction, should touch but not overlap, usually make a straight line, and measurement starts at one end and finishes at the other end",
        "Start measuring from the center of the object",
      ],
      correctAnswer:
        "Units should be the same size and direction, should touch but not overlap, usually make a straight line, and measurement starts at one end and finishes at the other end",
      feedback: {
        correct:
          "Absolutely correct! When measuring with non-standard units, consistency and alignment are key to obtaining an accurate measurement.",
        incorrect:
          "Not quite correct. When using non-standard units for measurement, it's important to ensure they are all the same size and are placed in a straight line without overlapping, starting from one end of the object to the other.",
      },
    },
